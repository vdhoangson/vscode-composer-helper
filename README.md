## Features

- Display currently installed package version next to package entry (on document save)
- Hover over package names to get insights about the package
- Hover over package names to get the currently installed and latest available package version

- Command to install / update dependencies inline

## Requirements

You should have [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed. But the plugin is actually not relying on it.
